# dependencytree package

This package recursively reads a directory and creates an adjacency list representation of the dependencies in the directory.

## Contributing

The logic for the package is all in `graph.go`. `dependor.json`, and everything in `test_tree` exists so that the code can be tested. Depending on the feature being added to dependencygraph, you may need to add more test files to the test_tree directory.
